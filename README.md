# RFID-Electronic-Lock

An electronic lock I created that uses a MSP432P401R microcontroller communicating with a MFRC552 RFID reader to determine a "locked" or "unlocked" state. Written in C

This project was created in Code Composer Studio for use with the TI MSP432P401R, and uses libraries provided by TI.
